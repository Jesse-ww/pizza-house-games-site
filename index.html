                    <p class="vt323-regular fb">
                        Pizza House was started to create and share games that my friends and I would enjoy playing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The AAA industry has shifted, and with every new release players are treated more like ATMs. Every year I find fewer games that I want to play and even fewer that deliver on their promises.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I want games to be about fun again. I miss going to the store, picking out a game for my Gameboy and getting to just play. No day one DLC or patches, no game breaking bugs, just fun. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Games, for the most part, were about art, entertainment, and wonder. I think we've lost that. But I also think we can get it back.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        That's why Pizza House. I make games for players, for the art, for fun, for the wonder they bring, and for the inspration they can give. For people to <strong>enjoy</strong>.
